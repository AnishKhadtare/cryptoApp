# CRYPTO TRACKER

This project is where I developed a REACT based web application to help cryptocurrency investors in tracking the price of current market of top crypto currencies and also analyze its past performance on different timeline scales using graphical representation and used Tailwind CSS for designing the UI of the project.

As we all know Crypto Currency market is highly volatile market and not every one is able to keep track of there investments all th time. In order to solve this problem I have developed an application which provides real time data of about 100 diffrent cryptocurrencies and also gives in detail description of price of every cryptocurrency according to differnet timelines like daily, monthly, quaterly and yearly using visually apealing graphs.

It uses chart.js for creating such visually appealing graphs for easy analysis of fluctuations in prices of cryptocurrencies.

It also uses ContextAPI for increasing the efficiency in exchanging unique properties of components and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application. It helps in allowing one to share state across the entire app with ease.

It also has a news section where users can keep themself up to date by reading recent related news.
Here are some of the screenshots of the project working :
